# Frontend Take-Home Exercise

My task was to build a webpage with a user creation form. 

```
Inputs:
- Full Name
- Email
- Password
- Occupation
- State
```

## User Stories
- Displays a form for user to use
- Occupation and State should allow users to select from options returned by an endpoint. Users should only be able to select one occupation and one state.
- Can't submit form without having all fields filled in
- Provides a feedback upon submission

## Challenges
- importing components and thinking where I should put them
- typos
- i was using sweetalert but the pop up kept closing very quickly so i had to use window alert to make it easy
- making input fields red when not filled in

## List of technologies
- Javascript, CSS, and React
